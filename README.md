# Random Password Generator

## Description
This password generator will go through a series of prompts to ask the user what kinds of characters it would like to use for the password and how long the password should be.

This is our week 3 challenge to use the JavaScipt we have learned so far and apply it through using arrays and for loops to generate a random password using only the selected criteria gathered through the prompts.

Going through this project felt more like a challenge on how we could use our resources (Google) and a reiteration of the importance of pseudo coding. When I tried to start this project my mind went into so many different directions I quickly realized I needed to slow down and start to pseudo code!
